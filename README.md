## 
I don't use twitch that often, so filter isn't updated regularly. Just what I see when I browse sometimes.
I use the tag as a filter and since Twitch tags don't mean anything for browsing experience, I made my own filter.  
The other filter is for sorting by Highest->Lowest views and filtering view botters.
