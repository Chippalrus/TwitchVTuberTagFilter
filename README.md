## 
My definition of a VTuber is defined as:
> ***Primarily*** of streams/vods/content are in relation/protraying a PNG, live2D or 3D model of a character.
> Simply putting up a model next to a FleshCam with no significance does not constitute as one.

I don't use twitch that often, so filter isn't updated regularly. Just what I see when I browse.
I use the VTuber tag as a filter, but since Twitch tags can be misused I made a filter list.
Bias/False positives are possible but I do my best to manually check before putting anyone on the list.
