## 
I don't use twitch that often, so filter isn't updated regularly. Just what I see when I browse.
I use the VTuber tag as a filter, but since Twitch tags can be misused I made a filter list.  
The other filter is for sorting by Highest->Lowest views and filtering view botters.

## More Info
My definition of a VTuber is defined: ***Primarily*** or ***Signifigant portion*** of archives are using either using a PNG, live2D or 3D model of a character.
Bias/False positives are possible but I do my best to manually check before putting anyone on the list.
